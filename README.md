# mercator-origins-tiger

As of May 2023, Tiger is mostly a passenger in the Diver Console. He is currently carrying Nixie Clock code (see the code for acknowledgements to the author) which has been modified by me to provide a count-up and countdown timer in addition to the clock (which is initialised on start-up to internet time via an NTP server connection). He has a connection to the leak sensor in the diver console and will alarm if water droplets form a short in the leak sensor wiring. There is no connection currently to Mako, but now that ESPNow is now going to being used for comms between Tiger and the as-to-named audio module ESP microcontroller this is how comms will be established with Mako.

Tiger will eventually be used to show a menu for additional control of Mako and also show a nice little image of the next navigation target - ie the tipped up boat or 737 fuselage that are in the lake at Wraysbury dive centre, near Staines, UK.
